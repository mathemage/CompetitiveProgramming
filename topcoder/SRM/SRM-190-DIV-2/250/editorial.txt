A fitting problem to follow March Madness. In order to calculate the points per shot, you need to know 3 things: the total number of points, the number of free throws attempted, and the number of field goals attempted. The simplest way to find all of these is to just have 6 separate cases, one for each possible value of the elements. Clearly, you should just copy and paste these strings from the problem statement, since typing them in yourself is a good way to introduce typos. That was by far the most common solution, and pretty much everyone got it right. There are a few ways in which you could get clever if you really wanted to, but with only 6 cases to deal with, coding each one up is pretty simple.
