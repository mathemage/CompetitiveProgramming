An easy problem to start the day. Most of the successful solutions looked essentially like this:

  int netGain = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < amounts.length; i++)
     if (i == finalResult)
        netGain -= amounts[i] * centsPerDollar[i];
     else
        netGain += amounts[i] * 100;
  return netGain;

A slightly shorter variation, but one that is easier to get wrong, is to pretend everybody lost their bets in the loop, and then adjust for those who actually won afterwards.

  int netGain = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < amounts.length; i++) 
     netGain += amounts[i] * 100;
  netGain -= amounts[finalResult] * 100;
  netGain -= amounts[finalResult] * centsPerDollar[finalResult];
  return netGain;

I've written the last three lines separately for clarity, but they can easily be combined into a single, long line.

With so few failures, it's hard to generalize any common mistakes, but the only mistake that appears to have been made twice is to covert the loss into dollars before eventually converting the total into cents.
