<html><body bgcolor="#000000" text="#ffffff"><table><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Problem Statement</h3></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td>We have a number of periodic tasks, each with its own period and execution time.
At the beginning
of each period of the task (at time 0, 0+period, 0+2*period, ...) a job becomes 
ready to run, requiring execution time on the cpu.
<p>
The jobs are scheduled preemptively, based on the priority of the task to which
they belong. Among all the jobs that are ready to execute, the job that is 
running on the cpu is always a job from the highest priority task. If a job
from a higher priority task becomes ready, the currently running job is removed
from the cpu and will remain ready to execute, needing only the remainder of
its original execution time.
</p><p>
The response time for a job is the time between when it first became ready, 
and when it completed its execution.  Create a class Response that contains
a method response that is given int[] <b>period</b> and int[] <b>execution</b> and that 
returns the response time of the first job of the lowest priority task. If the 
response time is greater than 1,000,000 or if the first job of the lowest priority task never finishes return -1. 
</p><p>
The i-th element of <b>period</b> and the i-th element of <b>execution</b> apply to
the i-th task. The tasks are given in order of decreasing priority.

   The schedule is as follows, referring to the tasks in order as A, B, and C:  
   The first job of A runs from 0-4. Then the first 5 jobs of B are executed from 4-9. Then C's first job runs from 9-10 and is interrupted at time 10 when B's next job becomes ready.  The remaining usage of the processor continues as follows: 
   B:10-11, C:11-12: B:12-13, C:13-14, B:14-15, C:15-16, B:16-17, C:17-18, 
   B:18-19, C:19-20, A:20-24, B:24-29, C:29-30, B:30-31, C:31-32.  At this
   point C has accumulated 8 units of cpu time so its first job has finished
   executing.
