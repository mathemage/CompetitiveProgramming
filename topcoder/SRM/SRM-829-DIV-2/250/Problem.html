Your friend just took part in a game show.
</p>
<p>
During the game show your friend was asked a sequence of <b>N</b> questions.
The questions were numbered from 0 to <b>N</b>-1 in the order in which they were asked.
Each question had an assigned dollar amount: for question i this amount was <b>A</b>[i].
</p>
<p>
The rules of the game are as follows:
The contestant starts the game with an empty bank.
Whenever the contestant answers a question correctly, the amount assigned to that question goes to the contestant's bank.
But whenever the contestant answers incorrectly, they lose everything that is currently in their bank.
At the end of the game the contestant wins the amount that is in the bank at that moment.
</p>
<br></br>
<p>
You are given the int <b>N</b> and the vector &lt;int&gt; <b>A</b> with <b>N</b> elements.
You are also given the int <b>W</b>.
</p>
<p>
Your friend claims that in the game show he won exactly <b>W</b> dollars. 
</p>
<br></br>
<p>
You don't know what questions your friend was asked. More importantly, you don't know how he answered and which of his answers were correct.
</p>
<p>
Return "possible" if your friend can be speaking the truth, or "impossible" if you can be sure that it's not the case.
