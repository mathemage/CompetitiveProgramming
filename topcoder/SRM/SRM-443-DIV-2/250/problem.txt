Problem Statement
    
In soccer, all the major national leagues are conducted in the following way:  A league consists of several teams. Over the course of a year, each team must play exactly two matches against each of the other teams - one at its own stadium and one at the opponent's stadium. When a team plays at its own stadium, it is called the "home team" and its opponent is called the "away team". Each match ends in one of three possible results: a home team victory, a draw, or an away team victory. Each time a team wins, it is awarded 3 points. When there's a draw, both teams are awarded 1 point. No points are awarded for a loss. The overall ranking of the teams is based on the total number of points received by each team.  You are given a vector <string> matches. The j-th character of the i-th element of matches denotes the result of the match between team i and team j at team i's stadium. 'W' represents a home team victory, 'D' represents a draw, and 'L' represents an away team victory. All characters on the main diagonal of matches will be '-' because a team never plays against itself. Return a vector <int> where the i-th element is the total number of points received by the i-th team.
