The major issue with this problem, was correctly parsing the input. Once complete, the actual computation was trivial. The C++-ish solution uses a single sscanf statement, or a few stringstreams. A Java-ish solution uses either StringTokenizer, or split combined with a replaceAll regular expression:

       input.replaceAll("([-+*/])"," $1 ").split(" ");

Understanding the above code, gives some good insight into Java regular expressions.
