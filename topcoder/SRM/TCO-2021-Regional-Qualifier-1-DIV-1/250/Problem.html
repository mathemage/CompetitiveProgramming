Olympic shooting competitions are done in rounds of 25 shots. 
Obviously, whoever hits more targets wins.
Ties are broken in an interesting way: using the Countback Rule.
Below we quote this rule from the official rulebook.
</p>
<br></br>
<p>
9.15.1.2 Countback Rule
</p>
<p>
Any ties to be broken by this method must be decided as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
The scores of the last round of 25 targets must be compared.
The winner is the athlete with the highest score in that round.
</li>
<li>
In a case where the tie is still not broken, the round before last must be compared and if still not broken, the round before that and so on; and
</li>
<li>
If the results of all the rounds are still equal, ties must be decided by counting backward,  target  by  target,  from  the  last  target  of  the  last  round  (and  if  necessary, the next to the last round etc.) until a tie-breaking zero (0) is found.  If  the  tied  athletes  have  zeroes  (0)  on  the  same  target,  the  countback  shall  continue until the tie is broken.
</li>
</ol>
<br></br>
<p>
If two shooters have exactly the same shooting record, the above rule will conclude that they are still tied.
If the tie still needs to be broken (e.g., to decide who gets a medal), the shooters who are still tied after the Countback Rule is applied have a shoot-off.
</p>
<p>
In this problem we will assume that all ties left after the Countback Rule is applied must be resolved via a shoot-off.
We will also assume that whenever a shoot-off takes place, the shooter with the smaller number performs better.
</p>
<br></br>
<p>
You are given the shooting records of N shooters in the vector &lt;string&gt; <b>results</b>.
For each i, <b>results</b>[i] is the shooting record of shooter number i.
Each '1' represents a hit, each '0' is a miss.
</p>
<p>
Determine the final standings of this shooting competition and return it as a vector &lt;int&gt; with the competitor numbers ordered from best to worst.
All ties need to be broken: first by using the Countback Rule, and the ones that remain by a shoot-off.

Here we also have a second round of shooting. In the second round each shooter only hit one target. These hits change the order produced by the Countback Rule.
</p>
<p>
E.g., when comparing shooters 2 and 4, we see that they both have score 1 for the last round, they both have score 24 for the first round, and then we see that on the very last shot of the competition shooter 4 succeeded while shooter 2 failed.
