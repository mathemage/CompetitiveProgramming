DuckTales: The Quest for Gold is an old computer game.
In the game, the player had to navigate the characters through various minigames.
One of those is a cavern exploration game that inspired this problem.
</p>
<br></br>
<p>
The cave consists of a rectangular grid of chambers.
Two chambers are adjacent if they are next to each other in the same row or column of the grid.
When in the cave, the player may only move between adjacent chambers.
</p>
<p>
Some of those chambers contain pits.
If the player enters such a chamber, they fall into the pit and die.
The player's primary goal is to avoid dying.
</p>
<p>
Pits spread moisture.
Therefore, each chamber that is directly adjacent to a pit will have slime on its walls.
Slime does not occur anywhere else and therefore it can be used as a warning system: if the player sees the slime, they know that at least one of the adjacent chambers contains a pit.
</p>
<p>
At most one chamber contains treasure.
The player's secondary goal is to find the treasure, if there is one.
</p>
<p>
The player has no knowledge of the cave.
At the beginning of the game they are teleported into one of the chambers.
When they find the treasure or give up, they are teleported back out.
</p>
<br></br>
<p>
You are shown the map of such a cave: a vector &lt;string&gt; <b>cave</b> in which each character represents one cell.
The character 'P' is a pit, the character 'S' is where the player starts, the character 'T' is the treasure, and '.' are all other cells.
Note that slime isn't explicitly shown on the map.
We also stress that only you know the entire map, the player does not know it.
</p>
<p>
If the player will find the treasure, return "gold" (quotes for clarity), if they won't, return "no gold".
