<html><body bgcolor="#000000" text="#ffffff"><table><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Problem Statement</h3></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td><p>
An election has just finished.
There were two candidates: A and B.
Each voter voted for one of the two candidates.
The winner will be the candidate who received more votes.
Thus, there are three possibilities for the outcome: A won, B won, or the election is a tie.
</p>
<p>
You are a journalist who observes the election committee.
Your task is to report the outcome of the election as quickly as possible.
</p>
<br></br>
<p>
The votes cast are given in the string <b>votes</b>: each 'A' is a vote for candidate A and each 'B' is a vote for candidate B.
You know the total number of votes cast (i.e., the length of the string <b>votes</b>).
</p>
<p>
The election committee is counting the votes in the order in which they are given in the string.
Luckily, you just realized that you probably won't have to be there until the very end.
It is quite likely that you will already know the outcome of the election before the last vote has been counted.
</p>
<p>
For example, suppose the votes cast are <b>votes</b> = "AABAABAAB".
The election committee will count the votes in this order: one vote for A, another vote for A, then a vote for B, and so on.
After they count the first seven votes ("AABAABA") you will already know the election result.
(Candidate A is leading with five votes to two, and the remaining two votes can no longer change the winner of the election.)
</p>
<br></br>
<p>
Return the smallest X such that the result of the election will be known after the first X votes have been counted.
