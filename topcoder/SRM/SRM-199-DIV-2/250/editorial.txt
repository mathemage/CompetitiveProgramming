This problem required a program to multiply a string sFactor by an integer iFactor, according to a provided definition for performing such a multiplication. The first step is to reverse sFactor if iFactor is negative. Then, to an empty string, concatenate abs(iFactor) copies of sFactor.

In pseudocode:

    if iFactor < 0 {
        reverse sFactor
        iFactor = -iFactor
    }

    ret = ""
    for i = 1 to iFactor {
        ret = ret + sfactor
    }

    return ret
If implemented correctly, you do not need to worry about the special cases of the string being empty or the integer being zero, although sometimes it's easier to just code the special cases explicitly than to convince yourself that your program handles them correctly.
